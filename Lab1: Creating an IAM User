## Overview

This lab guides you through creating an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) user in your AWS account. You will perform hands-on tasks to set up an
IAM user and prepare submission details for the IAM User AutoGrader. This
activity reinforces your understanding of IAM users and prepares you for secure
AWS resource management.

## 1. Log in to the AWS Management Console:

• Navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com and sign in to your
AWS account (e.g., account ID: 236921907600).

## 2. Access the IAM Service:

• In the AWS Console, search for “IAM” and select the IAM service.

## 3. Create a New IAM User:

• In the IAM dashboard, click “Users” in the left menu, then click “Create
user”.
• Enter a username, e.g., student1. Ensure it’s unique and memorable.
• Check “Provide user access to the AWS Management Console” if you
want console access.
• Optionally, set a password (choose “Custom password” or “Autogener-
ated password”) and note it for your records.
• Click “Next”.

## 4. Set Permissions:

• For this lab, select “Attach policies directly” and choose a policy like
AWSReadOnlyAccess to grant minimal permissions.
• Click “Next” and then “Create user”.


## 5. Note the Username:

• Record the username (e.g., aia.kctolentino) for AutoGrader submission.
